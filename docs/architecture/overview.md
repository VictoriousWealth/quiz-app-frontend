# 🧱 System Design Overview

## 🎯 Goal
Build a full-stack AI-powered quiz web application that allows users to upload learning materials (PDF, DOCX, TXT), generate quizzes from the content using Gemini AI, take the quizzes, receive AI-evaluated feedback, and track their progress over time.

## 🗂️ Architecture Style
This is a **classic client-server architecture**, with a React frontend interacting with a FastAPI backend via RESTful API calls. User authentication is handled using **JWT tokens** with optional support for **OAuth2**.

## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. Frontend (React.js + Bootstrap)
- Responsive, accessible UI with support for **dark/light mode**
- Upload interface for learning files
- Quiz interface with answer tracking
- Results page with explanations
- Dashboard and history tracking

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)
- Exposes RESTful API endpoints to the frontend
- Handles file upload and text parsing
- Generates quizzes via Gemini API
- Stores and evaluates user responses
- Manages user authentication (JWT)

### 3. AI Integration (Gemini API)
- Generates quiz questions from raw content
- Stores context to evaluate quiz submissions in the same conversation
- Returns correct answers and explanations per question

### 4. Database (PostgreSQL)
- Stores uploaded files, quizzes, user answers, and results
- Enables users to reattempt quizzes and track their history
- Associates quiz content with the original uploaded file
